# "Babylon 3D Experiences" Code For MinneWebCon2018

## Gulp Setup
This project is setup with a basic gulp setup that utilizes TypeScript,
browsersync and uglify. It was based on [this tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/gulp.html).

## Setup and Run

You will need gulp or yarn installed to run this example. If you have
yarn simply run:
* yarn
* yarn run gulp

That will download the required node_modules and then build the
project. Once built it will automatically open your web browser with the
example.
